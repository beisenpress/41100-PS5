# 1 Can observational studies replicate experiments?
# In class we studied data from the National Supported Work (NSW) experiment. Men were 
# randomized to either receive job training (the treatment) or not (control). We found the 
# average treatment effect was $1,794.34: treated men could expect to earn this much more than 
# controls. What if we didnâ€™t have a randomized experiment? Could we still estimate this causal
# effect from observational data? Answering these questions is the goal of this problem.

# Suppose that the same 185 men received job training, and we want to know what 
# effect this training had on income, but we do not have access to the NSW control sample. 
# That is, no experiment was done. We need a control sample to compare too, and for this we 
# have 2490 men drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). This is now observational 
# data. The full data consists of the 185 treated men and these 2490 men to act as controls 
# (file nsw_psid.csv).
